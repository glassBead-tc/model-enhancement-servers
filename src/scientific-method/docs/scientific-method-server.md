# Scientific Method MCP Server

## Motivation

Language models often struggle with applying rigorous scientific reasoning. While they can describe the scientific method, they frequently:

1. Jump to conclusions without systematic hypothesis testing
2. Fail to explicitly identify assumptions underlying their reasoning
3. Conflate correlation with causation in explanatory claims
4. Neglect alternative explanations for observed phenomena
5. Show inconsistency in evaluating evidence across different hypotheses
6. Make predictions without clear falsifiability criteria

The Scientific Method Server addresses these limitations by providing an external framework that guides models through formal scientific reasoning processes. By externalizing the scientific method, models can engage in more rigorous, transparent, and self-correcting inquiry.

## Technical Specification

### Tool Interface

```typescript
interface HypothesisData {
  // Core hypothesis components
  statement: string;
  variables: Array<{
    name: string;
    type: "independent" | "dependent" | "controlled" | "confounding";
    operationalization?: string;
  }>;
  assumptions: string[];
  
  // Hypothesis metadata
  hypothesisId: string;
  confidence: number; // 0.0-1.0
  domain: string;
  iteration: number;
  
  // Relationships
  alternativeTo?: string[]; // IDs of competing hypotheses
  refinementOf?: string; // ID of parent hypothesis
  
  // Current status
  status: "proposed" | "testing" | "supported" | "refuted" | "refined";
}

interface ExperimentData {
  // Core experiment components
  design: string;
  methodology: string;
  predictions: Array<{
    if: string;
    then: string;
    else?: string;
  }>;
  
  // Experiment metadata
  experimentId: string;
  hypothesisId: string;
  controlMeasures: string[];
  
  // Results (if conducted)
  results?: string;
  outcomeMatched?: boolean;
  unexpectedObservations?: string[];
  
  // Evaluation
  limitations?: string[];
  nextSteps?: string[];
}

interface ScientificInquiryData {
  // Process stage
  stage: "observation" | "question" | "hypothesis" | "experiment" | "analysis" | "conclusion" | "iteration";
  
  // Content for current stage
  observation?: string;
  question?: string;
  hypothesis?: HypothesisData;
  experiment?: ExperimentData;
  analysis?: string;
  conclusion?: string;
  
  // Process metadata
  inquiryId: string;
  iteration: number;
  
  // Next steps
  nextStageNeeded: boolean;
}
```

### Server Implementation

The server maintains:

1. An `inquiryHistory` array containing all stages of scientific inquiry
2. A `hypothesisRegistry` mapping hypotheses to supporting/refuting evidence
3. An `experimentRegistry` tracking experimental designs and results

For each scientific inquiry update, the server:

1. Validates the content based on scientific method principles
2. Updates the appropriate registry (observations, hypotheses, experiments)
3. Formats the scientific process visually
4. Returns metadata about the inquiry state and next recommended steps

### Process Flow

```mermaid

    participant Model
    participant SciServer as Scientific Method Server

    Model->>SciServer: Submit observation (stage=observation)
    SciServer->>State: Store observation
    SciServer-->>Model: Return inquiry state
    
    Model->>SciServer: Formulate question (stage=question)
    SciServer->>State: Store question
    SciServer-->>Model: Return inquiry state
    
    Model->>SciServer: Propose hypothesis (stage=hypothesis)
    SciServer->>State: Store hypothesis
    SciServer-->>Model: Return inquiry state
    
    Model->>SciServer: Design experiment (stage=experiment)
    SciServer->>State: Store experiment design
    SciServer-->>Model: Return inquiry state
    
    Model->>SciServer: Analyze results (stage=analysis)
    SciServer->>State: Update with analysis
    SciServer-->>Model: Return inquiry state
    
    Model->>SciServer: Draw conclusion (stage=conclusion)
    SciServer->>State: Store conclusion
    SciServer-->>Model: Return final state
    
    Model->>SciServer: Refine hypothesis (stage=iteration)
    SciServer->>State: Create new iteration
    SciServer-->>Model: Return updated inquiry state
```

## Key Features

### 1. Structured Scientific Process

The server enforces a structured scientific inquiry process:
- **Observation**: Making and recording observations about phenomena
- **Question**: Formulating specific, testable questions
- **Hypothesis**: Creating falsifiable hypotheses with variables
- **Experiment**: Designing controlled tests with predictions
- **Analysis**: Evaluating results against predictions
- **Conclusion**: Drawing warranted conclusions
- **Iteration**: Refining hypotheses based on results

### 2. Hypothesis Management

Hypotheses must be explicitly formulated with:
- **Statement**: Clear, testable proposition
- **Variables**: Identified and categorized (independent, dependent, etc.)
- **Assumptions**: Explicit underlying assumptions
- **Alternatives**: Competing explanations for same phenomena

### 3. Experimental Design

The server guides rigorous experimental design:
- **Methodology**: Clear procedural steps
- **Predictions**: Explicit if-then statements for expected outcomes
- **Controls**: Measures to eliminate confounding variables
- **Limitations**: Acknowledged constraints of the design

### 4. Evidence Evaluation

Evidence is systematically evaluated:
- **Confirmatory**: Evidence supporting hypotheses
- **Disconfirmatory**: Evidence challenging hypotheses
- **Unexpected**: Observations not predicted by hypotheses

### 5. Iteration Tracking

The server tracks how scientific understanding evolves:
- History of hypothesis refinements
- Changing confidence levels based on evidence
- Alternative explanations explored and rejected

## Usage Examples

### Causal Analysis
When attempting to determine cause-effect relationships, the model can systematically work through alternative explanations and evidence evaluation.

### Technical Troubleshooting
For diagnosing problems, the model can generate competing hypotheses about failure causes and design tests to differentiate between them.

### Literature Review
When synthesizing research findings, the model can systematically evaluate evidence quality and competing explanations.

### Health Diagnosis
For medical reasoning, the model can track hypothesis confidence for different conditions based on symptoms and test results.

## Implementation Notes

The server would be implemented using TypeScript with:
- A core ScientificMethodServer class
- JSON schema validation for scientific process structures
- Visualization for the scientific inquiry process
- Relationship tracking between hypotheses and evidence
- Standard MCP server connection via stdin/stdout

This server would provide significant enhancement to model reasoning in domains requiring causal analysis, hypothesis testing, and evidence evaluation - essentially any context where rigorous scientific thinking would benefit human reasoning as well.
